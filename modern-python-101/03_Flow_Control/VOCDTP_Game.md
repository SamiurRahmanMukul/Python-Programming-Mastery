Visualize - Outline - Code | Debug - Test - Polish

## Step 1 - Visualize

1. Can you try to visualize all the characters and their actions.
2. Can you try to visualize how Avengers will try to defeat Thanos.
3. Can you try and think what happens if Avengers are not successful.

## Step 2 - Outline

1. Can you convert the characters and actions into variables or constants.
2. Can you try to assign values to the variables/constants you just created.
3. Can you write steps in plain English, of how avengers can attack Thanos.

## Step 3 - Code

1. Declare all the variables/constants and assign values.
2. Can you translate the steps you wrote in Step 2 into logic.
3. Run you code and see if it works.

## Step 4 - Debug

1. If something is not working proper, can you debug the program.
2. Simple print statements can help a lot.

## Step 5 - Test

1. Test your program against all possible scenarios.
2.

## Step 6 - Polish

1. Now that your code is working, can you make it robust.
2. Can you make your program idiot proof.
3. Did you write all the necessary documentation.
4. Can you improve performance.
5. Can you simplify your code so that others can read it.
6. Did you group common functionality so that there is no repetition
