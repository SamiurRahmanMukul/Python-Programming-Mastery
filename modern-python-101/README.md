This is your guide to get started with Python Programming Language. This is a simple to understand and free guide to learn Python, we don't expect you to have any programming knowledge and teach everything from scratch. 

Did you check instagram today or watched YouTube? Well, you just used Python based applications! All fortune 500 companies use Python in some form or another, so fear not, learning Python is always a good decision!

Python is the perfect language to learn for beginners. With Python you can do almost anything, create your own web applications, create games, desktop applications, data science projects, AI, etc, the list is endless! Python is well suited for beginners because of its simplicity and you would be writing your own programs in no time!

Python is one of the easiest language to learn, while this may be true, but it often takes a lot of time and practice to really master it. People often confuse learning `language syntax` with learning `programming`, we make this difference very clear and guide you through the basic principles needed to learn Python in an efficient manner.

Remember, this course is just your start and there is no end to learning it!

## Learning Journey

It may take you multiple times to go through any particular Topic/Video/Concept and there is no shame in it. Anyone who says they got the concept in the first try are either really smart or lying, rest of us need repetition and practice to learn anything new.

Also remember, as a beginner there is no such thing as silly questions, so be sure to ask whatever you think is a genuine question.
